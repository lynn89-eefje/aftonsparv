# Aftonsparv

The revamped Hacktime Statistics Viewer for YSWS Organizers!

## About the project

Aftonsparv was made on SvelteKit, and is a revamped version of Oskar (hacklyn.city/oskar). YSWS organizers can easily view whole user data on Hackatime, trust factor, and combine the statistics from mutliple sessions into one unified view on Aftonsparv's UI. 

## How to use

Aftonsparv is available at hacklyn.city/aftonsparv

It is fully usable through GUI interaction; however, it also uses keybinds (mainly ESC key), which you can utilize as directed on the UI.
